This playbook consists of one task that installs four packages.

The task uses Ansible's built-in apt module to interact with the apt package manager which is used by the Ubuntu Linux operating system. To learn more about the apt Ansible module, see the ansible.builtin.apt â€“ Manages apt-packages page __https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/apt_module.html#ansible-collections-ansible-builtin-apt-module__ of the Ansible documentation.

Also, configuration the Apache webserver to enable a HTTPS site.

```

To run your Ansible playbook, enter the following command:

To confirm that the packages have been installed, re-run the dpkg command:

```
